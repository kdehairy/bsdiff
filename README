This is an implementation of the bsdiff binary diff method. This implementation differs in the following from the original implementation:
- It's a library.
- It consumes and outputs memory buffers instead of files directly.

see http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/ for the original implementation and notes from the author.

This is still an un-polished work. The interfacing with the library is not to my liking yet.
